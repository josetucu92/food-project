# FOOD PROJECT

The idea was to create an app where the user was able to see different recipies among with relevant info using the spoonacular API and from it beeing able to:

- Find recipipes.
- Filter / Sort.
- Create new recipes (in my DB).

The only endpoint/flag available for me to use was https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/complexSearch.

I wasn't allowed to use any library or framework for styling, having to do it with pure CSS.

The technologies I used for the project are:

   - HTML
   - CSS
   - JavaScript
   - React
   - Redux
   - Node
   - Express
   - PostgreSQL
   - Sequelize
